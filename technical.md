What architectures or patterns are you using currently or have worked on recently?
What do you think of them and would you want to implement it again?
What version control system do you use or prefer?
What is your favorite language feature and can you give a short snippet on how you use it?
What future or current technology do you look forward to the most or want to use and why?
How would you find a production bug/performance issue? Have you done this before?
How would you improve the sample API (bug fixes, security, performance, etc.)?

1.	The current technical assignment has implemented Clean architecture and CQRS pattern with MediatR. At work, the project we are currently developing uses the Adapter and Factory patterns along with Layered architecture. On my own free time I am currently involved with the Domain Driven Design, developing some small project out of curiosity to get acquainted.
2.	I would most certainly use them again, especially Clean architecture and CQRS because everything is unit testable(not a mix of integration testing). It distinguishes the single responsibility of each class, making the whole logic easy to track and allows the team to understand the applicationâ€™s flow better. 
3.	I prefer to use git distributed version control since it is integrated in Visual Studio with wide variety of other UI tools (like Sourcetree).
4.	I like asynchronous programming with async and await just because of the way the memory is allocated and managed during the performance of the methods. There is this async snippet pack for being more productive and save time.
5.	As the preview of .Net 6 is already out I am really looking forward to see what it has instore for us. I am really keen on using the hot reload feature that will save us all some time. In that line of thought also nice would be to see the improvement introduced into the AoT compilation.
6.	Working with Enterprise application, one of the surest methods to spot bugs is by checking logs. Of course there is always unit testing or manually testing the application to check if it produces the desired behavior.
7.	Had I enough time, I would restructure the API, implement Design patterns, use generics, clean architecture etc. It really depends on the purpose and the future usage of the API.
